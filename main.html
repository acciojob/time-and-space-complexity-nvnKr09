	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of its input size. It's a crucial factor in determining the performance of algorithms as input scales up. Time complexity is often denoted using big O notation, which represents the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's runtime. In essence, it quantifies how the algorithm's execution time changes as the input size increases. Designing algorithms with low time complexity is essential for creating efficient solutions, ensuring that computational resources are utilized optimally.

		<b>Space Complexity</b>, a vital concept in computer science, pertains to the efficient utilization of memory by an algorithm in relation to its input size. It measures how the memory requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases. In terms of memory usage, algorithms can be classified based on their <b>Space Complexity</b>, often represented as O(n) or other notations. O(n) indicates that the memory used by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size. As input scales, algorithms with lower <b>Space Complexity</b> are preferable, as they minimize memory consumption. Balancing time complexity and <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing algorithm performance, ensuring both efficient execution and prudent memory usage.
